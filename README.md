==========

+ 0.5h - Scoping & High level research
+ 0.5h - Scaffolding the project
+ 3.5h - Creating the app logic
+ 0.5h - Beautifying
+ 0.5h - QA

Total:

+ 4.5 hours necessary work
+ 5 hours with QA
+ 5.5 hours with 'user delight' additions


Things I would improve:

- CSS Styling
- Forcing logic to pick only one track per album. Currently multiple tracks from the same album can show up in the options list
- Better control over the answer clicks. Sometimes, during the notification animation, it fires another click event
- Drawing a border around both the correct answer and the option clicked by the user
- Splitting up the helpers, controller and data storage methods into separate files.
